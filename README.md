# Face Detection and Recognition System
## Introduction
The Face Detection and Recognition System project involves creating an AI application capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos. This project uses pre-trained models for face detection and deep learning techniques for face recognition.

## How It Works
The system functions through two primary processes:

Face Detection: The system uses pre-trained models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based detectors to locate faces in images.
Face Recognition: After detecting faces, a deep learning model such as a Siamese network or ArcFace is used to recognize the faces. Known faces are stored in memory for future recognitions.

## Steps to Run the Code
To run the Face Detection and Recognition System, follow these steps:

## Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-recognition.git
cd face-detection-recognition


## Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Images:

Place images of known faces in the project directory.
Ensure you have a test image containing faces you want to recognize.

## Run the Face Recognition Script:

python face_recognition.py
View the Output:

The script will output whether a face is recognized or unknown based on the provided known faces.

## Example Output
The system detects faces in the input image and recognizes known faces. If a known face is found, it prints "Face recognized!". Otherwise, it prints "Unknown face."

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required:
opencv-python
face_recognition
numpy

## Files
face_recognition.py: The main script containing the face detection and recognition implementation.
requirements.txt: A file listing the required Python packages.
